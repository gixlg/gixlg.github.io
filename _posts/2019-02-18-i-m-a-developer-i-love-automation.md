As lot of person in these days I also live in rented house.  
Every month I receive a mail with attached the fees about the gas or the electricity power for the apartment where I live, and every time I do these operations:
1. label it with a specific name with the corresponding year and month.
2. save the attachments in a folder on Dropbox
3. insert that information in a sheet on Google Drive formatted as that.  
(The value of fees and rent are fake, I don' like to share how much I pay üòÄ )  

<br/>
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/post-images/automation/SheetExpenses.png" >

I've done that several times.  


As all <del>good</del> developer **I'm lazy**.  


<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/post-images/automation/homer.gif" >


So I asked to myself: "Why I have to do the same operation manually every month?   
Can I automate this operation?".

In the first step I tried with IFTTT, but is not so powerful to do what I had in mind (or maybe I simply don't know it much üòÖÔ∏è).

After some research I tried with [Google App Script](https://script.google.com/home).  
Basically it is a Google's service that allow to write application in a javascript with the possibility to interact with the API of the Google Services like GMail and Drive.

<img style="width: 150px;" src="{{ site.url }}/images/post-images/automation/google-app-script.png" >

With it I've done this small experiment:
```javascript
function printMessagesInfo(messages){
  messages.forEach(function(message){
    var from = message.getFrom();
    var date = message.getDate();
    var subject = message.getSubject();
    
    Logger.log('Message subject: "%s" from: %s  date:%s', subject, from, date);
  });
}

function main() {
  var label = GmailApp.getUserLabelByName(configuration.labelNeedToBeProcessed);
  var threads = label.getThreads();
  for (var i = threads.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) { //Process them in the order received
    var thread = threads[i];    
    printMessagesInfo(GmailApp.getMessagesForThread(thread));
  } 
}

```
To test the App go to "Run" and than select the function to execute (in my case "main"). 
After that we can see the result clicking on "View/Log".

With this few line of code **I was able to search into all my Gmail account for the <del>mails</del> Threads that have a specific label**.  
In order to do that is necessary to allow the permission to the application to the Gmail API.




Ok Great it seams promising.  
Now le'ts try do do something useful,  
like the first task that I mentioned before.

```javascript
function getYearAndMonthStringFromDate(date){  
  if (date.getMonth() == 11) {    
    var nextMonth = new Date(date.getFullYear() + 1, 0, 1); //*2
  } else {
    var nextMonth = new Date(date.getFullYear(), date.getMonth() + 1, 1, date.getHours(), date.getMinutes(), 0, 0); //*2
  }
  
  var month = nextMonth.getUTCMonth() + 1; //months from 1-12
  var day = nextMonth.getUTCDate();
  var year = nextMonth.getUTCFullYear();
  
  var stringYear = "" + year;
  var stringMonth = month<10 ? '0'+month : "";
  return stringYear + "-" + stringMonth;
}

function processesThread(thread){
  var messages = GmailApp.getMessagesForThread(thread);
  var message = messages[0];      //In my scenario normally I have only one message for thread for that kind of mail
  var newLabel = "Home staff/"+getYearAndMonthStringFromDate(message.getDate());  //*3
  thread.addLabel(GmailApp.createLabel(newLabel)); 
}

function isThreadAlreadyProcessed(thread){
  return thread.getLabels().some(function(label){ return label.getName() == "Processed by Google Script" }); //*1
}

function main() {
  var label = GmailApp.getUserLabelByName("Need to be processed");
  var threads = label.getThreads();
  for (var i = threads.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) { //Process them in the order received
    var thread = threads[i];   
    
    if (!isThreadAlreadyProcessed(thread)){    
      processesThread(thread);
      thread.addLabel(GmailApp.getUserLabelByName("Processed by Google Script")); //*1
    }
  }  
}

```

Lot of staff in there, but still pretty simple.  

Let me do just a few comment.  
I added a flag [<sup>1</sup>] (to be precise the label `Processed by Google Script`) that allow to identify if a thead it is been already processed in order to avoid useless elaboration.    
In the function `getYearAndMonthStringFromDate` I did a  month +1 because for example the fee on January should be paid in February [<sup>2</sup>].  
Create a label like `Home staff/2019-02` means create a hierarchy. So `2019` is a sublabel of `Home staff` [<sup>3</sup>].

Well, with this code now I'm able to do the **first step of my checklist**.  
**<del>1. label it with a specific name with the corresponding year and month.</del>**

Now the goal is to do the second step!
So ideally our code can evolve on this: 

```javascript

function getYearAndMonthStringFromDate(date){  
  ...
}

function processesThread(thread){

  var messages = GmailApp.getMessagesForThread(thread);
  var message = messages[0];      //In my scenario normally I have only one message for thread for that kind of mail
  var yearAndMonth = getYearAndMonthStringFromDate(message.getDate());
  var newLabel = "Casa Gorgonzola/" + yearAndMonth;
  thread.addLabel(GmailApp.createLabel(newLabel)); 


  var attachments = message.getAttachments();
  attachments.forEach(function(fileBlob, index){
    Logger.log('"%s" (%s bytes)', fileBlob.getName(), fileBlob.getSize());    
    uploadAttachmentToDropbox(fileBlob, yearAndMonth, "pdf-"+index);    
  });
}


function uploadAttachmentToDropbox(attachment, date, name){
  var path = "Home staff/" + date + "/"+ date + "-" + name + ".pdf";
  uploadFileToDropbox(attachment, path);
}

function main() {
  ...
}

```
Nothing particular here the code is pretty straightforward.


To really upload the files on Dropbox I lean on the amazing Dropbox API and in particular I used this one: [file upload](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/documentation#files-upload).

Here's the piece of code that call that API:

```javascript
function uploadFileToDropbox(file, path) {
  
    var parameters = {
      "path": path,
      "mode": "add",
      "autorename": true,
      "mute": false
    };
    
    //Dropbox Access Token
    var dropboxAccessToken = "***************************************";
    
    var headers = {
      "Content-Type": "application/octet-stream",
      'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + dropboxAccessToken,
      "Dropbox-API-Arg": JSON.stringify(parameters)
    };
      
    var options = {
      "method": "POST",
      "headers": headers,
      "payload": file.getBytes()
    };
    
    var apiUrl = "https://content.dropboxapi.com/2/files/upload";
    var response = JSON.parse(UrlFetchApp.fetch(apiUrl, options).getContentText());
    
    Logger.log("File uploaded successfully to Dropbox in %s", path);
  }
```

Dropbox Access Token can be created from this [page](App Console) (and it shouldn't be shared).

Now we can delete the second point as well:  
**<del>2. save the attachments in a folder on Dropbox</del>**

Ok good, we miss the last level  üòÄ.

The hard part here is not insert the information in a Google sheet, but rather read the information.  
The file that I receive through email is/are a pdf hence is not easy read it like a normal text file.


<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/post-images/automation/pdf.jpg" >

After some research I found an amazing script:  [pdfToText](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26623198/5945360).  
That script basically use OCR feature offered by Google to convert a written documento to a text.
To activating this capability we need to enable the Drive API under  `Resources > Advanced Google Services`.  

<img style="width: 60%;" src="{{ site.url }}/images/post-images/automation/DriveAPI.png" >


Using that I was abel to get from a pdf like this: 

<img style="height: 400px;" src="{{ site.url }}/images/post-images/automation/fattura.png" >

a text like this:
```
""RIEPILOGO BOLLETTA Codice Cliente ********** Codice Fiscale *************************** *** * ** * ****** CONSUMI Totale Energia kWh Elettrica: 70 ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢...""
```

From that, assuming that the format of the pdf remains stable through the months with some text parsing we cat get all the meaningful info that we want.  
In my case from each invoice I get the following info:
```javascript
var invoceData = {
  company: "Enegan",
  type: "Energia Elettrica",
  value: 99
}
```

The info from each invoice are combined together and returned by `processesThread`.


```javascript
function processesThread(thread) {
  var messages = GmailApp.getMessagesForThread(thread);
  var message = messages[0];
  var yearAndMonth = getYearAndMonthStringFromDate(message.getDate());
  var newLabel = "Home/" + yearAndMonth;
  thread.addLabel(GmailApp.createLabel(newLabel));

  var result = {
    date: yearAndMonth,
    invoce: []
  };

  var attachments = message.getAttachments();
  attachments.forEach(function (fileBlob, index) {
    Logger.log('"%s" (%s bytes)', fileBlob.getName(), fileBlob.getSize());

    var filetext = pdfToText(fileBlob, { keepTextfile: false });
    var invoceData = getDataFromFileText(filetext);
    result.invoce.push(invoceData);

    uploadAttachmentToDropbox(fileBlob, yearAndMonth, invoceData.company);
  });

  return result;
}


function main() {
  .........
  for (var i = threads.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) { 
    .....
    var result = processesThread(thread);
    uploadInfoToGoogleSheets(result);
    ......
    
  }
}

```

At this point I have all the data that I need to fill up my sheet.
As before for take advantage of the Sheets API is necessary to give our authorization to the app. 

And this is the final piece of code that I'll show:

```javascript
function uploadInfoToGoogleSheets(input) {  
  var year = parseInt(input.date.substring(0,4));
  var month = parseInt(input.date.substring(5,7));
  fillSheetWithInfo(year, month, input.invoce);
  
}

function getMonthDiffFrom2018_02(year, month) {
    var months = (year - 2018) * 12 + month - 2;
    return months <= 0 ? 0 : months;
}

function getRowToEdit(year, month){
  var firtRowEditable = 3;
  var diff = getMonthDiffFrom2018_02(year, month);
  return firtRowEditable + diff;
}

function fillSheetWithInfo(year, month, invoce){
  var file = SpreadsheetApp.openById(config.googleSheetsFileId);
  Logger.log(file.getName());
  var row = getRowToEdit(year, month);  
  
  var sheet = file.getSheetByName("Foglio1");
  sheet.getRange("B"+row).setValue(year);     //The year
  sheet.getRange("C"+row).setValue(month);    //The number of the moth
  sheet.getRange("D"+row).setFormula(Utilities.formatString('=TEXT(DATE(B%s;C%s;1);"MMMM")',row,row)); //The month name
  sheet.getRange("E"+row).setValue(500);          //The rent
  sheet.getRange("F"+row).setValue(50);       //Condominium fees
  var valueForFormula = invoce.map(function(x) {
    return x.value;
  }).join(";");
  sheet.getRange("G"+row).setFormula('=SUM(' + valueForFormula + ')');  //The sum of fees

  var expenseDetails = invoce.map(function(x) {
    return x.company + "(" + x.type + ")";
  }).join(" + ");
  sheet.getRange("H"+row).setValue(expenseDetails);       //A description of the fees
  sheet.getRange("I"+row).setFormula(Utilities.formatString('=SUM(E%s;F%s;G%s)', row,row,row)); //The total expense

}

```
Here the most difficult thing was calculate the right row where to write the content.  
To do that I calculate the distance in terms of number of months between the first date in my table (so the 2018-02) to the date for the new entry.  
When the row is known is possible to write down all the info e.g. the rent, the condominium fees, the total sum, a small description for the type of expense and so on.

Finally we have automate also the last point.  
**<del>3. insert that information in a sheet on Google Drive formatted as that.</del>**

  

Now I have created a script that can do the operation that I did manually.  
**But still I have to run this script manually!**

So solve this issue I used a "Trigger", this allow to execute my function under some condition.
Is it possible to set a trigger from [G Suite Developer Hub](https://script.google.com/home/).
In my case was enough to set an execution one time for month.

And... DONE!!!!

## Conclusion
Google App Script gives me a level of freedom that other preconfigured services can't have.
It was a great solution for my use case.
For sure the ability to write code had give me the highest degree of flexibility and it's a great plus! 

The part that I didn't like was the "IDE", if we can call it. Write code on the web page wasn't comfortable at all, compared with VSCode or other tools.  
Another negative part wat that is not possible to use source control. Is possible to create different version of our code but is totally different to what we are used to do with git for example.   

These problems can be solved using [CLASP](https://github.com/google/clasp).  
Indeed you can find all the code on my [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/gixlg/GASP-Monthly-House-Fee-Calculator).
   
Maybe I will talk about it in another post. üòÅ
